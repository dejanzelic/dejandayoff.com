Natas5 starts me out with another "Access Denied" page. To see what is going on, I decide to capture the requests.

The first request I capture contains some interesting information:

Looking at the Cookies header, I notice one of the cookie is called "loggedin" and the value is currently set to 0. I wonder what would happened if I change that to a 1.

Looks like that was it! I was able to get a password for natas6:
