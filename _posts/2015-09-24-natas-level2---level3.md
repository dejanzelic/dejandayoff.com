The page says:

"There is nothing on this page"

hmmm... First I start with inspecting the element.

I saw that there was a random image. Lets navigate to that image:

As it says in the name, the image is just a pixel. I decided to try to see if they apache directory listing turned on and they do!

Once there I simply grabbed the users.txt file that contained the following users:

    # username:password
    alice:BYNdCesZqW
    bob:jw2ueICLvT
    charlie:G5vCxkVV3m
    natas3:sJIJNW6ucpu6HPZ1ZAchaDtwd7oGrD14
    eve:zo4mJWyNj2
    mallory:9urtcpzBmH
    
We are obviously looking for the password to natas3:
