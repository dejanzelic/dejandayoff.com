<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a Penetration Tester at Early Warning. I enjoy competing in CTFs, hack challenges, and building out my home lab. I took 4th place in Offensive Security's CTF at Blackhat 2016 and Savage Submarine, the team I compete with, took first place in DEF CON's 2016 CMD+CTRL CTF.</p>

<p>Before my security career, I was the owner of Live AZ DJ and AZ Audio Rent, two highly rated entertainment companies in the Phoenix area. I studied Computer Information Systems at W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. I held an internship at APS and Early Warning during college. Throughout my undergraduate career, I was involved in extracurriculars such as Peer Mentoring and the Honors Program. I was a recipient of the Blackhat scholarship as well as the Presidents' Scholarship.</p>
